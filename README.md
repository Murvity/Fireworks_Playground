# Fireworks Playground Script
This is a script for the game [Fireworks Playground](https://www.roblox.com/games/10846691679/3X-Fireworks-Playground-BETA#!/game-instances) on Roblox. As of right now, this can be used on both PC and mobile devices.

-------------------------------------------------------

## Important

Some things to note:

* Re-released as of 02/14/25, but everything works the same.
* The UI is now mobile friendly.
* There is now an Anti-AFK feature that's built-in (from Infinite Yield).
* Script is now obfuscated as an attempt to preserve its functionality.

### Unfortunately, this script will not work with some executors, including Solara and Xeno.
